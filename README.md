RobinStockScripts

This is a data science project.

The script integrates with the robin_stocks API allowing the user to add their RobinHood 
financial data to a CSV file for tracking their portfolio performance daily. 

The created CSV can be used to further manipulate asset data. 

The first run of the script gathers daily performance data adding these to a CSV file. 

After the first run of the script, the second run uses Matplotlib to visualize the asset performance in several ways.
